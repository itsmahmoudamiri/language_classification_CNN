# Project Name: Language Recognition with VGG16

## Description
This project aims to classify images containing texts in different languages using the VGG16 model, a popular convolutional neural network architecture. The model is trained on images labeled as Farsi, English, and Arabic, and it demonstrates proficiency in identifying these languages from images.

## Features
- Utilizes the VGG16 model for image recognition tasks.
- Customized for language recognition among Farsi, English, and Arabic.
- Employed techniques for preprocessing and augmenting image data.
- Trained and tested on a diverse dataset to ensure robust performance.

## Usage
Run the main script to start the training process:
```
python language_recognition.py
```

## Data
The data consists of images labeled as Farsi, English, and Arabic. The images were preprocessed and fed into the VGG16 model for training.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 88.9% on the test set. The detailed performance of the model can be visualized in the confusion matrix included in the `language_recognition.py` script.
